For each class a junit test class has been made.
So lets say for student class we have various options which take userinput.

So a mock input bytereaderstream has been setup where as per each case we pass a specific input.
That specific input checks for every if-else-case which occurs.
So basically case wise inputs have been made.

Some inputs require special start cases where in Semester start has been setup as per requirements.
This has been achieved by sometimes hardcoding the database before running All tests simultaneously.

In total 72 tests have been created by me where we have 98% accuracy.
Also total jacoco code coverage is 94% testcase.
Also intellij code coverage is 97% for optimal testcase.

For function with userinput a input bytestream is passed and finally if successful run occurs then true is returned and checked
@Test
void adminfunc2() throws SQLException {
    admin admin=new admin();
    ByteArrayInputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream("2\nCS556 CSE PC 4 4-3-2 CS202\n7\n".getBytes());
    System.setIn(in);
    assertTrue(admin.adminfunc());
}

For function with no input just compare the output with expected output
@Test
void regnew() throws SQLException {
    register re = new register();
    assertEquals(true,re.reg("1@iitrpr.ac.in","Student1","CS111","PC"));
}
